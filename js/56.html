<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings are written with quotes.
    You can use single or double quotes:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<p>You can use quotes inside a string,
    as long as they don't match the quotes
    surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
    var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

    var answer1 = "It's alright";
    var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
